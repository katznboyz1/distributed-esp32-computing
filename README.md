### This repo is currently a work in progress. I am currently working on the ESP32's command line.

*Currently, the master device will now allow up to 8 slave devices to sync to it over WiFi. It can also read from an SD card filesystem (the `DF` command I wrote is still in it's early stages, so it reads the wrong values).*

*I call it, "The Signal Integrity House of Horrors".*

### Specs:

- 520KB RAM
- 448KB ROM
- 240MHz processor clock speed
- 3 bit VGA colors (RGB)
- 640x350 output resolution
- 6 physical ESP32 devices

### Parts:

- 6x ESP32-S2 Dev Kit
- 1x Digital PmodSD

### Why am I doing this?

I have quite a bit of experience programming on high end desktop computers, and thought that it would be useful to learn how to program on a system with much tighter tolerances and lower specs.
