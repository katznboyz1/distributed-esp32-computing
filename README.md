### This repo is currently a work in progress. I am currently working on the ESP32's command line.

*The ESP32 now has a display output, and has a terminal that supports RGB colors. Created using the ESP32LIB VGA driver.*

*The (totally tidy) breadboard setup.*

### Specs:

- 520KB RAM
- 448KB ROM
- 240MHz processor clock speed
- 3 bit VGA colors (RGB)
- 640x480 output resolution
- 6 physical ESP32 devices

### Why am I doing this?

I have quite a bit of experience programming on high end desktop computers, and thought that it would be useful to learn how to program on a system with much tighter tolerances and lower specs.
